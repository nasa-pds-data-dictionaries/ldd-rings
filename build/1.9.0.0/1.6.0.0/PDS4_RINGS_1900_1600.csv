This is the common id by which data are identified within the Rings Node catalog. It describes the smallest quantity of data that can be usefully cataloged or analyzed by itself. Note that a single observation may be associated with multiple data products (e.g. raw and calibrated versions of an image). Note also that a single data product may be associated with multiple observations (e.g. a single WFPC2 image file containing four different images). A ring observation id is constructed using numbers, upper case letters, forward slash, colon, period, dash, and underscore as follows: p/type/host/inst/time/... where p is a single-letter planet id (one of J, S, U, or N); type is IMG for images, OCC for occultation profile, etc.; host is the instrument host id, inst is the instrument id; time is the observation time as a date or instrument clock count; further information identifying the observation can then be appended as appropriate.

This angle is constant for stellar occultations, but may vary significantly during radio occultations. Note: The direction of positive angular momentum points toward the IAU-defined north side of the ring plane for Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune, but IAU-defined south side of the ring plane for Uranus. Required in the label if the value is constant for the observation. If the angle varies for the observation, the min and max attributes are required in the label, and observed_ring_elevation is strongly recommended as a field in the data table.
