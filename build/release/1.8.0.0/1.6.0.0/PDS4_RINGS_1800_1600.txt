   name                   ring_observation_id
   version                1.1
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The ring_observation_id uniquely identifies a single experiment or observation (image, occultation profile, spectrum, etc.) within a rings-related data set. This is the common id by which data are identified within the Rings Node catalog. It describes the smallest quantity of data that can be usefully cataloged or analyzed by itself. Note that a single observation may be associated with multiple data products (e.g. raw and calibrated versions of an image). Note also that a single data product may be associated with multiple observations (e.g. a single WFPC2 image file containing four different images). A ring observation id is constructed using numbers, upper case letters, forward slash, colon, period, dash, and underscore as follows: p/type/host/inst/time/... where p is a single-letter planet id (one of J, S, U, or N); type is IMG for images, OCC for occultation profile, etc.; host is the instrument host id, inst is the instrument id; time is the observation time as a date or instrument clock count; further information identifying the observation can then be appended as appropriate. Optional in labels. Nillable, in which case the nil_reason should be 'inapplicable'. Examples: J/IMG/VG2/ISS/20693.01/N J/IMG/VG2/ISS/20693.02/W S/IMG/HST/WFPC2/1995-08-10/U2TF020B/PC1 U/OCC/VG2/RSS/1986-01-24/S U/OCC/VG2/RSS/1986-01-24/X N/OCC/VG2/PPS/1989-08-25/SIGMA_SGR

   name                   orbit_number
   version                1.1
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            orbit_number if present is the value assigned by the mission for the orbit number associated with the observation. Optional in labels of occultation observations and may be used multiple times. Nillable, the nil_reason should be 'inapplicable'. Normally not intended as a value for a table field. 
   nillable               true

   name                   source_pds3_id
   version                1.1
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            source_pds3_id is the PDS3 product identifier for the source product. If the source product has been archived under PDS4, use the Internal_Reference class in the Investigation_Area. source_pds3_id is constructed as PDS3 dataset_id, a colon, then the PDS3 product_id. The acceptable nil_reasons are 'inapplicable' and 'unknown'. 
   nillable               true

   name                   sclk_start_time
   version                1.1
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            sclk_start_time is the value of the spacecraft clock corresponding to the start_date_time given in the label. 

   name                   sclk_stop_time
   version                1.1
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            sclk_stop_time is the value of the spacecraft clock corresponding to the stop_date_time given in the label. 

   name                   reference_time_utc
   version                1.1
   value data type        ASCII_Date_Time_YMD_UTC
   description            reference_time_utc provides a date and time in UTC format. Given in a label when time values in a table are given as elapsed seconds offset from a reference time. Unless there are compelling reasons to do otherwise, reference_time_utc should correspond to the start of a day. Required anytime a table field is given relative to a specific date and time other than when Barycentric Dynamical Time is used (e.g., observed_event_tdb). 
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Time

   name                   observed_event_time
   version                1.1
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            observed_event_time indicates the instant at which photons were received at the instrument. As a field in an occultation profile table, it is given in numeric seconds as an offset from the specified UTC reference time. The reference time is preferably the start of a day. In a label the corresponding time interval end point values are given by the required start_date_time_utc and stop_date_time_utc attributes in the Time_Coordinates class. At least one of either observed_event_time or observed_event_tdb, must be a table field for occultation data. Both may be used. observed_event_time is equivalent to spacecraft_event_time for spacecraft data and to earth_received_time for Earth-based data. It is always the photon arrival time, so in this regard we treat typical spacecraft radio occultation data as Earth-based, referring to the time at the DSN receiving station. For an uplink radio occultation, this is the spacecraft event time. Note: For occultation data, PDS prefers year-month-day format for dates rather than year plus day-of-year format. However, either format is permitted.

   name                   maximum_observed_event_time
   version                1.1

   description            observed_event_tdb indicates the instant at which photons were received at the instrument. It is represented in the 'Barycentric Dynamical Time' system, as a number of elapsed seconds since the J2000 epoch. This is consistent with the definition of 'ephemeris time' as used in the SPICE toolkit. In a label the corresponding values are given by the optional start_observed_event_tdb and stop_observed_event_tdb attributes. At least one of either observed_event_time or observed_event_tdb, must be a table field for occultation data. Both may be used. observed_event_time is equivalent to spacecraft_event_time for spacecraft data and to earth_received_time for Earth-based data. It is always the photon arrival time, so in this regard we treat typical spacecraft radio occultation data as Earth-based, referring to the time at the DSN receiving station. For an uplink radio occultation, this is the spacecraft event time.

This is the signal level that indicates an opaque ring. Strongly recommended in labels of ring stellar occultation observations if the value is constant. For stellar occultations, if the value is not constant, strongly recommended to be used as a field in the data table. Normally not used for radio occultations.

   description            ring_longitude specifies the inertial longitude of a ring feature relative to the prime meridian. In planetary ring systems, the prime meridian is the ascending node of the planet's invariable plane on the Earth's mean equator of J2000. Longitudes are measured in the direction of orbital motion along the planet's invariable plane to the ring's ascending node, and thence along the ring plane. Values range from 0 to 360 in units of degrees. Note: The invariable plane of a planet is equivalent to its equatorial plane for every ringed planet except Neptune.

   version                1.1
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            observed_ring_elevation is an angle measured at a point in the ring plane, starting from the ring plane to the direction of a photon heading to the observer. This angle is positive on the side of the ring plane defined by positive angular momentum, and negative on the opposite side. Values range from -90 to +90 in units of degrees. This angle is constant for stellar occultations, but may vary significantly during radio occultations. Note: The direction of positive angular momentum points toward the IAU-defined north side of the ring plane for Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune, but IAU-defined south side of the ring plane for Uranus. Required in the label if the value is constant for the observation. If the angle varies for the observation, the min and max attributes are required in the label, and observed_ring_elevation is strongly recommended as a field in the data table. The above definition of observed_ring_elevation is equivalent to the most common usage of the term 'ring open angle', B.

   description            light_source_incidence_angle is an angle measured from the local surface normal vector to the direction of a photon arriving from the light source. For rings, the normal vector is that on the same side of the rings as the light source, so values always range between 0 and 90 in units of degrees. The value is always equal to 90 - | observed_ring_elevation | This will enable users to perform database searches based on the effective ring opening angle when they are not concerned about the the distinction between north-side and southside viewpoints. We have included the 'light source' prefix to the term so that this quantity is not confused with 'incidence angle', a term that is generally associated with sunlight rather than stars or radio transmitters. Required in the label if the value is constant for the observation. If the angle varies for the observation, the min and max attributes are required in the label. Optional as a field in the data table.
